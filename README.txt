Project: Axolotl Preserve

TAGLINE

Decentralized financial ecosystem that focuses on axolotl preservation and environmental 
sustainability. It combines blockchain technology with financial solutions to create a 
secure system.

PROBLEM IT SOLVES

Axolotl Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that aims to promote the 
conservation of axolotls. The platform will do this by:
* Allocating all profits to habitat protection and restoration projects.
* Educating the public about the importance of axolotls and biodiversity.
* Fostering innovation in the DeFi space by combining finance and conservation.

The platform will also feature a tracking and certification system that will help to:
* Raise funds to continue conservation work in the Axolotl sanctuary.
* Ensure the sustainability of the breeding and reproduction of axolotls.

Axolotl Finance will be a valuable tool for anyone who is interested in supporting the 
conservation of axolotls. The platform will make it easy for people to get involved in 
conservation efforts and to learn more about these amazing creatures.

Here are some of the benefits of using Axolotl Finance:
* You can support the conservation of axolotls by purchasing NFTs or tokens.
* You can learn more about axolotls and the importance of biodiversity.
* You can participate in a community of people who are passionate about conservation.

Axolotl Finance is a new and innovative platform that has the potential to make a real 
difference in the conservation of axolotls. If you are interested in supporting this 
important work, I encourage you to learn more about Axolotl Finance.

Here are some of the ways that Axolotl Finance can be used:
* *Conservationists* can use Axolotl Finance to raise funds for conservation projects.
* *Educators* can use Axolotl Finance to teach students about axolotls and the importance 
of biodiversity.
* *Investors* can use Axolotl Finance to invest in projects that are working to conserve 
axolotls.

CHALLENGES

Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) requires a Linux environment, such as Ubuntu, to perform 
and set up services and connections to its smart contracts. This can be achieved through 
the use of a virtual machine within the device or by activating the Linux subsystem for 
Windows (WSL v 2.0). The Linux subsystem for Windows allows developers to run a Linux distribution 
alongside their Windows OS, providing a seamless integration between Windows and Linux 
environments. This setup is particularly beneficial for blockchain development, as it 
enables the use of Linux-based tools and frameworks without needing to switch between 
operating systems.

Regarding transaction functions, it's important to note that while they may present bugs, these 
are areas of ongoing development and improvement within the blockchain community. 
The deployment of smart contracts involves storing both the back-end and front-end 
components. The back-end typically handles data processing and storage, while the front-end 
provides the user interface. This setup allows for a comprehensive development environment 
that supports the creation, testing, and deployment of decentralized apps (dapps).
